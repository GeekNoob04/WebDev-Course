# JavaScript Learning Repository 🚀

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript files, each demonstrating different concepts and techniques. It serves as a learning resource for developers looking to improve their JavaScript skills. From basic syntax and data types to asynchronous programming and DOM manipulation, this repository covers a wide range of topics.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Fundamental Concepts:** Demonstrations of variable declaration, data types, and operators.
*   **Functions:** Examples of function definitions, arrow functions, and function expressions.
*   **Loops:** Implementations of `for`, `while`, `for...in`, and `for...of` loops.
*   **String Manipulation:** Techniques for accessing, modifying, and formatting strings.
*   **Arrays:** Examples of array destructuring and spread syntax.
*   **Objects:** Demonstrations of object creation and manipulation.
*   **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Usage of `async/await` and Promises for handling asynchronous operations.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Examples of event handling and dynamic content updates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Environment:** Browser (with DOM API)
*   **Other:** HTML (for some examples involving DOM manipulation)

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
*   A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)

### Installation

No installation is required. Simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeekNoob04/WebDev-Course
cd WebDev-Course
```

### Running Locally

Each directory within the repository represents a separate example or lesson. To run a specific example:

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file you want to run (e.g., `video55`).
2.  If the directory contains an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`), open it in your browser. The JavaScript code will be executed automatically.
3.  If the directory only contains a JavaScript file, you can run it in your browser's console by opening the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and pasting the code into the console. Alternatively, you can create an HTML file and include the JavaScript file using `<script>` tags.
